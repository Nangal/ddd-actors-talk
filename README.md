[DDD, EventSourcing and Actors](https://sessionize.com/s/alexey-zimarev/ddd_event_sourcing_and_actors/22561) talk

Premiered at WROC# where not everything went well :)

An improved version will be at KanDDDinsky and it might even be recorded.

## Important!

Read-models aren't done properly yet. Give me some time during summer to finialise everything!
